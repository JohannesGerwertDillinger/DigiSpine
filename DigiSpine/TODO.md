## Obvious TODOs

- [ ] Validate produce/consumer against updates/failure
  - https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#upgrade_350_kraft
- [ ] https://github.com/lensesio/stream-reactor
  - Validate supported 
- [ ] Document decisions 
- [ ] Secure external connection protocols?! (e.g. SSL, alternatively use encrypted overlay network?)
  - https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/kafka/authentication_ssl.html
  - https://dockerlabs.collabnix.com/advanced/security/networking/

## Decisions so far
- [x] validate data/log storage so that they are stored in a separate volume and exist after update/location rotation ins swarm
- [x] Which image -> Confluent due to their support time and possibility to commercial support  
  - Note: Versioning of confluent
    - https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/installation/versions-interoperability.html
